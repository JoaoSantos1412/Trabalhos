\subsubsection{Tensors of Higher Rank}
Tensor products of lower-rank tensors, represented by $\otimes$, can be used to create higher-rank tensors. Tensor products of vector and dual vector spaces can be used to build a basis for these higher-rank tensors. The following is an expression for a mixed tensor $T$ of rank $(p,q)$ schematically:
\begin{equation}
T=T^{\mu_1\mu_2...\mu_p}_{\nu_1\nu_2...\nu_q}e_{\mu_1}\otimes e_{\mu_2} \otimes ... \otimes e_{\mu_p} \otimes e^{\nu_1}\otimes e^{\nu_2} \otimes ... \otimes e^{\nu_p}
\end{equation}
where $\{e_\mu\}$ is a vector basis and ${e^\nu}$ is a dual vector basis. A rank-2 tensor $T$ covariant, contravariant and mixed components are given by
\begin{align}
T(e_\mu,e_\nu)=T_\mn && T(e^\mu,e^\nu)=T^\mn && T(e_\mu,e^\nu)=T_\mu^\nu && T(e^\mu,e_\nu)=T^\mu_\nu 
\end{align}
thus, the vectors $A$ and $B$,
\begin{equation}
T(A,B)=T(A^\mu e_\mu,B^\nu e_\nu)=T(e_\mu,e_\nu)A^\mu B^\nu=T_\mn A^\mu B^\nu
\end{equation}
Finnaly, lets consider the scalar product $A\cdot B=g_\mn A^\mu B^\nu$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
g(A,B)&=g(A^\mu e_\mu,B^\nu e_\nu)=g(e_\mu,e_\nu)A^\mu B^\nu\\
&=g_\mn A^\mu B^\nu=A^\mu B_\mu\, \in \, \mathbb{R}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Thus, we conclude that $g_\mn$ represents a rank-2 tensor of type (0,2).
